# Introduction

Welcome to the Advantage API from Over The Top! You can use our API to access Advantage API endpoints, which will get you access to many of the features and functionality of Advantage.

We have language bindings in Shell, and C# but you can use any language you choose! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```

```c#
using OverTheTop.Advantage;

API api = API.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Advantage uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can find your Advantage API key in the Advantage control panel under Admin menu and by selecting My Clinic option.

Advantage expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `meowmeowmeow` with your personal API key.
